## Contributing

If you'd like to see a feature, you can request it - but creating a pull request is an even better way to get things
done.

Either way, please feel comfortable submitting issues or pull requests: all contributions and questions are warmly
appreciated :).

> **NOTE**
>
> Should you want to contribute, please make sure to use the git hooks so the Terraform is always well formatted and the
> README file is up to date.
